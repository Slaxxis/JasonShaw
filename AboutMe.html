    const aboutText = `I am Jason Shaw Jr, a 17 year old High School senior at Fernandina Beach High School in Florida. Aside from playing musical instruments, my primary passions include solving problems, and figuring the universe out.

    The questions that have always enticed me are the ones that are not easily answered, and so I have made it my life’s mission to learn as much as I can about anything and everything. Several years ago I built my first computer, and it’s from this entry into the digital world where I really began to realise my purpose. 
    
    I have spent countless hours scrolling through the deepest corners of the internet and absorbing as much knowledge as I could grasp. From History to Physics, nothing that poses a question is boring to me, and so I consider myself to be as much of a teacher as a student.

    My relationship with engineering is a complicated one to say the least. Most of the questions posed by engineering are much more easily answered than those posed by other fields, however the direct connection between theory and application in engineering makes it by far the most appealing to me. I have plans to complete a bachelor's degree in engineering, and I have most recently also been considering postgraduate studies so I can pull my chosen field forward even further. 

    Over the last several years my personal academic interests have produced several publications from various different but related fields: A geometric integral formula, This website and all of its projects, and most recently, a research paper on Dielectric Elastomers, just to name a few.

    It is my hope that this website and all of its content might serve as a portfolio for all my past, present and future projects, whatever those may be. The pursuit of answers is not always easy, but the feeling of something you spent hours, months, or years working on is too great to ignore.
